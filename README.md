# Postgres for MySQL Users #

This is a quick [showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff/) presentation on the basics of using Postgres and the psql command-line tool, meant for people who are somewhat familiar with MySQL. It doesn't dive terribly deep.

* [This postgresql.org wiki page on moving to PostgreSQL](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Things_to_find_out_about_when_moving_from_MySQL_to_PostgreSQL). It's quite dated (from 2001), but it's mostly accurate, except for the bits about MySQL not having views, etc.
* [Wikibook page on converting from MySQL to PostgrSQL](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Converting_MySQL_to_PostgreSQL), which has a rather extensive table comparing different queries.
